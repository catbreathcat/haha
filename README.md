# XY=K DEX Dashboard Demo
This code template is a showcase of the [XY=K suite of Covalent API endpoints](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/Get%20XY=K%20pools/USD/1) powering a multi-chain DEX dashboard.

## Live Demo
GitHub pages - https://covalenthq.github.io/dex-dashboard-template

The live demo displays:
* Both blockchain and DEX selectors
* A DEX token summary
* A DEX market sentiment and socials summary
* Details of the asset pairs traded on the DEX

## Fork and Customize
While this code template is primarily meant to be a demo of the [XY=K suite of Covalent API endpoints](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/Get%20XY=K%20pools/USD/1) to power multi-chain DEX dashboards, the code is open source and forkable for you to customize it as you like.

In `src/config.js`, there are some basic config settings that can be updated such as:
* Your own Covalent API key
* Dashboard title
* Dashboard header banner

Currently, [all supported DEXs](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/Get%20XY=K%20supported%20DEXes/USD/1) and their corresponding blockchains are shown with the default DEX being Uniswap on Ethereum mainnet. Changes to these defaults can be made in `src/App.js`
